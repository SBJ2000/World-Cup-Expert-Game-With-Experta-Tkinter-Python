## Project Description

 This project is an expert system developed in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems. It leverages a domain-specific knowledge base and utilizes an inference engine to simulate reasoning. The objective is to guess the national team the player is thinking of in the context of the World Cup. The application achieves this by asking a series of questions to the player, facilitated by an AI. The project is developed using Python with tkinter for the frontend and experta as the library.
